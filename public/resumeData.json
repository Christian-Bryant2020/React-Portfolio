    "bio":"Hello! My name is Christian Bryant and I love to create fun and intuitive applications. My developer path started when I moved to Austin, Tx in the fall of 2020. The world was being ravaged by a pandemic and I knew I wanted to use my skills and dedication to make a difference in this world. I enrolled into the University of Texas Full Stack Developemnt Bootcamp in December of 2020 and have been marching full speed ahead since. Making the world a better place has been at the heart of my dedication and actions. Within my portfolio you will find your next best friend with my Pet Cupid application that searches a database of nearby shelters by pet type. Once you find your partner in crime, stop by my VaccineTracker to post and keep track of your vaccine status and ensure you remember that second appointment. Please feel free to stop by my contact page and send suggestions or comments and view my Linkedin and Github! Thank you for stopping by!",
